####Run ANOVA on this#####
    #The ANOVA shows that the mean prevalence of Cliona sponges differs significantly between reef complexes (ùêπ= 6.625 F=6.625,ùëù= 0.00414 p=0.00414). However, it does not specify which groups differ; the Tukey HSD test provides those pairwise comparisons.

# Perform Tukey's HSD test
   #Significant Difference:
 #Mesophotic vs. Nearshore: There is a significant reduction in mean prevalence in Mesophotic sites compared to Nearshore sites (p = 0.0030).
    #No Significant Difference:
 # Offshore vs. Nearshore: No significant difference in mean prevalence (p = 0.1506). 
 # Mesophotic vs. Offshore: No significant difference in mean prevalence (p = 0.2067).

##Summary of resutls 
    #The ANOVA results indicate a statistically significant effect of location on the prevalence of Cliona sponges. With 32 degrees of freedom associated with Location and 2787 degrees of freedom associated with the residuals, the analysis reveals that the variation in prevalence between locations is substantial. The Sum of Squares for Location is 1.648, and the residual Sum of Squares is 10.196. The Mean Square for Location is calculated as 0.05152, compared to the residual Mean Square of 0.00366. The F-value for Location is 14.08, which is the ratio of the Mean Square for Location to the residual Mean Square. This high F-value suggests that the differences in prevalence across locations are much greater than the within-location variability.

    #The p-value associated with this F-value is less than 2e-16, which is extremely small and highly significant. This result indicates that the differences in prevalence between locations are statistically significant at any conventional significance level (e.g., 0.05, 0.01, 0.001). Therefore, we can confidently reject the null hypothesis, concluding that the prevalence of Cliona sponges is not uniform across locations. These findings suggest that some locations have significantly higher or lower prevalence than others, warranting further investigation to identify specific locations with notably high or low prevalence values. Further pairwise comparisons, such as Tukey‚Äôs HSD test, would help determine which specific locations differ in terms of prevalence.

#This code generates a jitter plot to show the prevalence of Cliona sponges at various locations, with each point representing data from a specific year. Locations are ordered by prevalence, and points are colored by SampleYear to distinguish different years.

Labels and a minimal theme enhance readability, with x-axis labels rotated for better visualization.
